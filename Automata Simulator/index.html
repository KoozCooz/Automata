                    <p><b>Automata Theory</b> Is the study of abstract computing devices, or “machines”. A study of mathematical model of a computer which can determine whether a particular string is in a language. Concept that describes how machine mimic human behavior. <br /> <br />
                      Is an abstract model of a digital computer. Every automaton includes some essential features. It has mechanism for reading input. It is also assumed to operate in a discrete time frame. A mathematical model for a finite state machine. A finite state machine is a machine that given an input, jumps through a series of states according to a transition function that tells the automaton which state to go next given a current state and a current symbol. <br /> <br />
                      <b>There are important notations that are not automaton-like, but play an important role in the study of automata and their application.</b><br /><br />

                      – are useful models when designing software that processes data with a recursive structure, the best known example is a “parser”, the component of a compiler that deals with recursively nested features of the typical programming languages. <br />
                      <b>2. Regular Expression</b> <br />

                    <p><b>Deterministic finite automata</b> (or DFA) are finite state machines that accept or reject strings of characters by parsing them through a sequence that is uniquely determined by each string. <br /> <br />
                      In a DFA, for a particular input character, the machine goes to one state only. A transition function is defined on every state for every input symbol. Also in DFA null (or Λ) move is not allowed, i.e., DFA cannot change state without any input character. <br />
                      There can be many possible DFAs for a pattern.  A DFA with minimum number of states is generally preferred.

        <h2>What is Deterministic Finite Automata?</h2>
        <p><b>Deterministic finite automata</b> (or DFA) are finite state machines that accept or reject strings of characters by parsing them through a sequence that is uniquely determined by each string. <br /> <br />
            The term “deterministic” refers to the fact that each string, and thus each state sequence, is unique. In a DFA, a string of symbols is parsed through a DFA automata, and each input symbol will move to the next state that can be determined.These machines are called finite because there are a limited number of possible states which can be reached. <br /> <br />

            <b>P</b> is a set of production rules, which is used for replacing non-terminals symbols(on the left side of the production) in a string with other terminal or non-terminal symbols(on the right side of the production).<br />
            <b>S</b> is the start symbol which is used to derive the string. We can derive the string by repeatedly replacing a non-terminal by the right-hand side of the production until all non-terminal have been replaced by terminal symbols.<br /><br />
